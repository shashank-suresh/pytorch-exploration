# Tensors
- In PyTorch, we use tensors to encode the inputs and outputs of a model, as well as the model’s parameters
- **Tensors are similar to NumPy’s ndarrays**, except that tensors can run on GPUs or other hardware accelerators
- Tensors and NumPy arrays can often share the same underlying memory, eliminating the need to copy data
- Tensors are optimized for automatic differentiation
